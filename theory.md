### INTRODUCTION<br>

#### Pitot Static Tube

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;"> Developed between 1952 and 1954 by the National Physical Laboratory and manufactured since 1955 by Airflow Developments Limited, the modifided ellipsoidal knows pitot static tube is recommended in BS 1042 Part-II.</p>


<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">The Pitot-static tube is an instrument which uses the principle of pressure exerted by flowing air and is suitable for measurements of high velocity. It is not capable of measuring average velocity directly but measures the velocity at a given point in the airway/duct. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">The instrument consists of two concentric tubes out of which the outer tube, which contains perforations in the form of small holes drilled at right angles to its periphery, measures the static head while the inner tube measures the total head. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;"> The accuracy of the readings obtained from the pitot-static tube depends on the angle of yaw. The angle of yaw is the angle between the direction of airflow and the horizontal axis of the head of the pitot-static tube. The maximum permissible angle of yaw for least error is around 100 (0.175 rad). 
</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;"> During measurement, it is advised to keep the lowest angle of yaw by turning the head of the pitot-static tube in different directions by trial and error. At the lowest angle of yaw, the velocity pressure recorded will be highest. The pitot-static tube can measure velocities accurately over a large range and the minimum velocity that it can measure generally depends on the sensitivity or capacity of the manometer being used with it. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">The size of the pitot-static tube to be used for a given duct depends on the size of the duct itself. For ducts of diameters less than 200mm, it is preferable to use small sized pitot-static tubes rather than the normal sized ones which are generally used in mine roadways. This ensures that accuracy of the reading is not compromised. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Since the reading obtained by a Pitot-static tube gives only the point velocity it is necessary to adopt a technique to obtain the average velocity of the airway. To do this, the cross section of the airway/duct is divided into a number of equal areas similar in shape to the complete opening and the velocity at the centre of each area is measured by this instrument. These readings are averaged over the whole area of the airway to give an estimate of the average air velocity throughout the cross section of the airway.

#### U-Tube Manometer

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">This essentially consist of a U tube, one limb of which a tube of uniform bore (6mm internal dia) and inclined at a low angle with the horizontal, while the other limb is large reservoir whose cross sectional are  300-400 times that of inclined tube so that any change in the level of the manometric fluid in the reservoir can be neglected in comparison with the change in fluid level in the inclined tube. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">A scale is placed along the inclined tube directly reads the pressure difference. For low pressure measurement, a low value for the angle of inclination is chosen, whereas for high pressure measurement, the value of the angle of inclination is increased.
